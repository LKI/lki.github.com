          <p>Today I watched an inspiring video about <strong>Dream</strong></p>

<p>Video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5NF01Rpepo">here on youtube</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really inspiring. Especially on the long hot summer night :)</p>

<p>Go watch it. You will get inspired up too.</p>

<p>And the lines is as below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know what that dream is that you have. I don’t care how disappointing it might have been, as you’ve been working toward that dream. But that dream your holding in your mind that it’s possible that some of you already know that it’s hard. It’s not easy. It’s hard changing your life. That in the process working on your dreams you are going to incur a lot of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain. At moments when you‘re going to doubt yourself and say God why is this happening to me. I’m just trying to take care of my children, and my mother. I’m not trying to steal or rob from anybody. How does this have to happen to me?<br />
For those of you all that have experienced some hardships don’t give up on your dream. The rough times are going to come, but they are not going to stay. They have come to pass.</p>

<p>Greatness is not this wonderful, esoteric, illusive god-like feature that only the special among us will ever taste. It’s something that truly exists in all of us.</p>

<p>It’s very important for you to believe that you are the one.<br />
Most people they raise a family, they earn a living and then they die. They stop growing, they stop working on themselves, they stop stretching, and they stop pushing themselves. Then a lot of people like to complain but they don’t want to do anything about their situation. And most people don’t work on their dreams, why? One is because of fear, that they have fear of failure. What if things are worked out? And the fear of success, what if they do and i can’t handle it. These are not risk-takers.</p>

<p>You spend so much time with other people, you spend so much time trying to get people to like you. You know other people more than you know yourself. You studied them you know about them, you want to hang out like them, you want to be just like them. And you know what you’ve invested so much time on them, you don’t know who you are. I challenge you to spend time by yourself.</p>

<p>It’s necessary, that you get the losers out of your life, if you want to live your dream. But people who are running towards their dreams, life has a special kind of meaning.</p>

<p>When you become the right person, what you do is start separating yourself from other people. You begin to have a sudden uniqueness. As long as you follow on other people, as long as your being a copycat you will never ever be the best copycat in the world. But you will be the best you could be. I challenge you to define your value.</p>

<p>That everybody won’t see it, that everybody won’t join you, that everybody won’t have the vision. It is necessary to know that. That you are an uncommon breed.<br />
It is necessary that you align yourself with people and attract people into your business, who are hungry. People who are unstoppable and unreasonable, people who are refusing to live life just as it is and who want more. The people that are living their dreams. are seeking winners to attach themselves to. The people that are living their dreams, are the people that know that if it’s gonna happen it’s up to them.</p>

<p>If you want to be more successful. If you want to have and do stuff you’ve never done before, I’m asking you to invest in you. To invest in you!</p>

<p>Someone’s opinion of you, does not have to become your reality. That you don’t have to go through life being a victim. And even though you face disappointments, you have to know within yourself, that I can do this, even if no one else sees it for me, I must see it for myself.</p>

<p>This is what I believe and I am willing to die for it. Period.</p>

<p>No matter how bad it is or how bad it gets, I’m going to make it.</p>

<p>I want to represent an idea. I want to represent possibilities.</p>

<p>Some of you right now, you want to go to the next level. I want a council, I want to be an Engineer, I want to be a Doctor. Listen to me. You can’t get to that level. You can’t get to that level economically where you want to be, until you start investing in your mind. You’re not reading books. I’m challenging you all to go to conference. I dare you to invest time. I dare you to be alone. I dare you to spend an hour to get to know yourself.</p>

<p>When you become who you are, when you become the person you are created to be, designed to be who you were designed to be. When you become an individual. What you do is take yourself and start separating yourself from other people.</p>

<p>I’m challenging you to get to a place where people do not like you or do not even bother you anymore. Why? Because you are not concerned about trying to make them happy. Because your trying to blow it, you’re trying to get to the next level. I need you to invest in your mind.</p>

<p>If you’re still talking about your dreams. If you’re still talking about your goals. But you have not done anything yet, just take the first step.</p>

<p>You can make your parents proud. You can make your school proud. You can touch millions of lives and the world will never be the same again because you came this way. Don’t let anybody steal your dream. Don’t let nobody steal your dream! After we face rejection and a “NO”, we have a meeting and no one shows up, or somebody said you can count on me, and they don’t come through. What if we had that type of attitude that cause repossess, nobody believes in you, you’ve lost again and again and again. The lights are cut off, but you still are looking at your dream, reviewing it everyday and saying to yourself, IT’S NOT OVER UNTIL I WIN!</p>

<p>You can live your dream.</p>
